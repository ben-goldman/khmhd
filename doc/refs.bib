  abstract = {Collisionless plasma instabilities are fundamental in magnetic field generation in astrophysical scenarios, but their role has been addressed in scenarios where velocity shear is absent. In this work we show that velocity shears must be considered when studying realistic astrophysical scenarios, since these trigger the collisionless Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz instability (KHI). We present the first self-consistent three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the KHI in conditions relevant for unmagnetized relativistic outflows with velocity shear, such as active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. We show the generation of a strong large-scale DC magnetic field, which extends over the entire shear-surface, reaching thicknesses of a few tens of electron skin depths, and persisting on timescales much longer than the electron timescale. This DC magnetic field is not captured by magnetohydrodynamic models since it arises from intrinsically kinetic effects. Our results indicate that the KHI can generate intense magnetic fields yielding equipartition values up to {$\epsilon$}B/{$\epsilon$}p {$\simeq$} 10-3\textendash 10-2 in the electron timescale. The KHI-induced magnetic fields have a characteristic structure that will lead to a distinct radiation signature and can seed the turbulent dynamo amplification process. The dynamics of the KHI are relevant for non-thermal radiation modeling and can also have a strong impact on the formation of relativistic shocks in presence of velocity shears.},

The third considers two-dimensional turbulence and compressible (in particular, supersonic) turbulence. Because of the similarities in the theoretical approach, these chapters start with a brief account of the corresponding methods developed in hydrodynamic turbulence. The final part of the book is devoted to astrophysical applications: turbulence in the solar wind, in accretion disks, and in the interstellar medium.

The results are interpreted on the basis of a scaling analysis of the governing equations. The analysis suggests that there are two different strongly stratified regimes according to the parameter . When , viscous forces are unimportant and lv scales as lv {$\sim$} U/N (U is a characteristic horizontal velocity and N is the Brunt\textendash V\"ais\"al\"a frequency) so that the dynamics of the flow is inherently three-dimensional but strongly anisotropic.

The parameter  is further shown to be related to the buoyancy Reynolds number and proportional to (lO/{$\eta$})4/3, where lO is the Ozmidov length scale and {$\eta$} the Kolmogorov length scale. This implies that there are simultaneously two distinct ranges in strongly stratified turbulence when : the scales larger than lO are strongly influenced by the stratification while those between lO and {$\eta$} are weakly affected by stratification. The direct numerical simulations with forced large-scale horizontal two-dimensional motions and uniform stratification cover a wide Re and Fh range and support the main parameter controlling strongly stratified turbulence being . The numerical results are in good agreement with the scaling laws for the vertical length scale.

The Dedalus project is a flexible, open-source, parallelized computational framework for solving general partial differential equations using spectral methods. Dedalus translates plain-text strings describing partial differential equations into efficient solvers. This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom analysis outputs can also be specified in plain text and stored in self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation.},

  abstract = {The amplification of magnetic fields plays an important role in explaining numerous astrophysical phenomena associated with binary neutron star mergers, such as mass ejection and the powering of short gamma-ray bursts. Magnetic fields in isolated neutron stars are often assumed to be confined to a small region near the stellar surface, while they are normally taken to fill the whole star in numerical modeling of mergers. By performing high-resolution, global, and high-order general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the impact of a purely crustal magnetic field and contrast it with the standard configuration consisting of a dipolar magnetic field with the same magnetic energy but filling the whole star. While the crust configurations are very effective in generating strong magnetic fields during the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz-instability stage, they fail to achieve the same level of magnetic-field amplification of the full-star configurations. This is due to the lack of magnetized material in the neutron-star interiors to be used for further turbulent amplification and to the surface losses of highly magnetized matter in the crust configurations. Hence, the final magnetic energies in the two configurations differ by more than 1 order of magnitude. We briefly discuss the impact of these results on astrophysical observables and how they can be employed to deduce the magnetic topology in merging binaries.},

The dynamo operates by the interaction of two MHD processes: the production of toroidal magnetic field from poloidal field by the shear, and the regeneration of poloidal loops from toroidal field due to the combined action of magnetic buoyancy and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The nature of the dynamo process is such that it can occur only if the initial magnetic fields exceed a critical value that typically depends on the magnetic Reynolds number. As such, this dynamo does not operate in the kinematic limit. Several different behaviors are observed, including steady dynamo production and cyclic as well as chaotic activity. In the cyclic regimes, the dynamo process exhibits polarity reversals and periods of reduced activity.},

  abstract = {Most turbulent flows appearing in nature (e.g. geophysical and astrophysical flows) are subjected to strong rotation and stratification. These effects break the symmetries of classical, homogenous isotropic turbulence. In doing so, they introduce a natural decomposition of phase space in terms of wave modes and potential vorticity modes. The appearance of a new time scale, associated with the propagation of waves, hinders the understanding of energy transfers across scales. For instance, it is difficult to predict a priori whether the energy cascades downscale as in homogeneous isotropic turbulence or upscale as expected from balanced dynamics. In this paper, we suggest a theoretical approach based on equilibrium statistical mechanics for the ideal system, inspired by the restricted partition function formalism introduced in metastability studies. We focus on the qualitative features of the inviscid system, taking into account either all the modes or just the slow modes. Specifically, we show that at absolute equilibrium, i.e.~when all the modes are considered, no negative temperature states exist, and the isotropic energy spectrum is close to equipartition. By contrast, when the statistics is restricted to the contributions of the slow modes, we find that in the presence of rotation, there exists a regime of negative temperature featuring an infrared divergence in both the isotropic and the axisymmetric average energy spectrum, characteristic of an inverse cascade regime. Such regimes are not allowed for purely stratified flows, even in the restricted ensemble, because the slow manifold then partitions into modes that carry potential vorticity on the one hand, and hydrostatically balanced but vorticity-free modes, the so-called vertical shear horizontal flows, on the other hand, which forbid the appearance of negative temperatures.},

The calculated energy spectra are used to develop an empirical model for the dissipation range which accurately represents the bottleneck.

  abstract = {, Stratified turbulence has a horizontally layered structure with quasi-two-dimensional vortices due to buoyancy forces that suppress vertical motion. The Prandtl number Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} quantifies the relative strengths of viscosity and buoyancy diffusivity, which damp small-scale velocity and buoyancy fluctuations at different microscales. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) require high resolution to resolve the smallest flow features for large Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}. To reduce computational demand, Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} is often set to 1. In this paper, we explore how varying Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} affects stratified turbulence. DNS of homogeneous forced stratified turbulence with 0.7{$\leq$}Pr{$\leq$}80.7 \textbackslash le \textbackslash textit \{Pr\} \textbackslash le 8 are performed for four stratification strengths and buoyancy Reynolds numbers Reb\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b between 0.5 and 60. Energy spectra, buoyancy flux spectra, spectral energy flux and physical space fields are compared for scale-specific Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-sensitivity. For Reb{$\greaterequivlnt$}10\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b \textbackslash gtrsim 10, Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-dependence in the kinetic energy is mainly found at scales around and below the Kolmogorov scale. The potential energy and flux exhibit more prominent Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-sensitivity. As Reb\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b decreases, this Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-dependence extends upscale. With increasing Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}, the spectra suggest eventual convergence to a limiting spectrum shape at large, finite Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}, at least at scales at and above the Ozmidov scale. The Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-sensitivity of the spectra in the most strongly stratified Reb{$<$}1\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b{$<$}1 case differed from the rest, since large horizontal scales are affected by viscosity and diffusion. These findings suggest that Pr=1\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}=1 DNS reasonably approximate Pr{$>$}1\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} {$>$} 1 DNS with large Reb\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b, as long as the focus is on kinetic energy at scales much larger than the Kolmogorov scale, but otherwise stray from Pr{$>$}1\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} {$>$} 1 spectra around and below the Kolmogorov scale, and even upscale when Reb{$\lessequivlnt$}1\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b \textbackslash lesssim 1.},

Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

Fluid dynamics is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical phenomena, such as the formation and internal dynamics of stars and giant planets, the workings of jets and accretion discs around stars and black holes and the dynamics of the expanding Universe. Effects that can be important in astrophysical fluids include compressibility, self-gravitation and the dynamical influence of the magnetic field that is `frozen in' to a highly conducting plasma. The basic models introduced and applied in this course are Newtonian gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal compressible fluid. The mathematical structure of the governing equations and the associated conservation laws are explored in some detail because of their importance for both analytical and numerical methods of solution, as well as for physical interpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves, including shocks and other discontinuities, are discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a supernova, and involving a strong shock, is a classic problem that can be solved analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or axial symmetry reveal the physics of winds and jets from stars and discs. The linearized equations determine the oscillation modes of astrophysical bodies, as well as their stability and their response to tidal forcing.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fields are expected to play a key role in the dynamics and the ejection mechanisms that accompany the merger of two neutron stars. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations offer a unique opportunity to unravel the details of the ongoing physical processes. Nevertheless, current numerical studies are severely limited by the fact that any affordable resolution remains insufficient to fully capture the small-scale dynamo, initially triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and later sourced by several MHD processes involving differential rotation. Here, we alleviate this limitation by using explicit large-eddy simulations, a technique where the unresolved dynamics occurring at the subgrid scales (SGS) is modeled by extra terms, which are functions of the resolved fields and their derivatives. The combination of high-order numerical schemes, high resolutions, and the gradient SGS model allow us to capture the small-scale dynamos produced during the binary neutron star mergers, as shown in previous works. Here, we follow the first 50 milliseconds after the merger and, for the first time, we find numerical convergence on the magnetic field amplification, in terms of integrated energy and spectral distribution over spatial scales. Among other results, we find that the average intensity of the magnetic field in the remnant saturates at {$\sim$}1016 G around 5 ms after the merger. After 20\textendash 30 ms, both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components grow continuously, fed by the winding mechanism that provides a slow inverse cascade, i.e., gradually transferring kinetic into magnetic energy. We find no clear hints for magnetorotational instabilities and no significant impact of the magnetic field on the redistribution of angular momentum in the remnant in our simulations, probably due to the very turbulent and dynamical topology of the magnetic field at all stages, with small-scale components largely dominating over the large-scale ones. Although the magnetic field grows near the rotation axis of the remnant, longer large-eddy simulations are necessary to further investigate the formation of large-scale, helical structures close to the rotational axis, which could be associated to jet formation.},

The evolution of the mixing layer includes shear instability, formation of Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz rollers, transition to turbulence, fully developed active turbulence, and, finally, decay toward a laminar state. In the Jd case, internal gravity waves carrying momentum and energy are observed to propagate away from the shear layer. Although different during the initial evolution, the eddy diffusivity and mixing efficiency when plotted as a function of buoyancy, Reynolds number takes similar values between the two cases later in time during the stage when turbulence decays. During this stage, the mixing efficiency computed based on the buoyancy flux is approximately 0.35, while the mixing efficiency estimated from the scalar dissipation is approximately 0.4. Parameterization of the eddy diffusivity in terms of Reynolds numbers and gradient Richardson number is also discussed.},

The results qualitatively confirm the plateau\textendash cusp shape, which is often assumed to be universal, but show a strong dependence on the test filter size. Increasing stable stratification not only breaks the isotropy of the SEV but also modifies its basic shape, which poses a great challenge for implicit and explicit LES methods.

The vertical scales decrease and the vertical shearing increases with time, maintaining the Richardson number of order 1, as suggested by Lilly [J. Atmos. Sci. 40, 749 (1983)] and Babin et al. [Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 9, 223 (1997)]. Small-scale instabilities and turbulent-like motions are observed to occur in the high shearing regions, while the larger-scale motions appear to evolve somewhat independently of the Reynolds number. The results suggest that the larger-scale, quasi-horizontal motions would be a continuous source of smaller-scale turbulence until the local Reynolds number drops below a critical value, which is estimated. Finally, a Froude number based upon a vertical differential scale and used in previous scaling arguments and theories is estimated in terms of other parameters.},

Their aim is to provide a self-contained graduate-student level introduction to the theory and modelling of the dynamo effect in turbulent fluids and plasmas, blended with a review of current research in the field. The primary focus is on the physical and mathematical concepts underlying different (turbulent) branches of dynamo theory, with some astrophysical, geophysical and experimental context disseminated throughout the document. The text begins with an introduction to the rationale, observational and historical roots of the subject, and to the basic concepts of magnetohydrodynamics relevant to dynamo theory. The next two sections discuss the fundamental phenomenological and mathematical aspects of (linear and nonlinear) small- and large-scale MHD dynamos. These sections are complemented by an overview of a selection of current active research topics in the field, including the numerical modelling of the geo- and solar dynamos, shear dynamos driven by turbulence with zero net helicity, and MHD-instability-driven dynamos such as the magnetorotational dynamo. The difficult problem of a unified, self-consistent statistical treatment of small and large-scale dynamos at large magnetic Reynolds numbers is also discussed throughout the text. Finally, an excursion is made into the relatively new but increasingly popular realm of magnetic-field generation in weakly-collisional plasmas. A short discussion of the outlook and challenges for the future of the field concludes the presentation.},

  abstract = {There is a clear distinction between simple laminar and complex turbulent fluids; however, in some cases, as for the nocturnal planetary boundary layer, a stable and well-ordered flow can develop intense and sporadic bursts of turbulent activity that disappear slowly in time. This phenomenon is ill understood and poorly modeled and yet it is central to our understanding of weather and climate dynamics. We present here data from direct numerical simulations of stratified turbulence on grids of 20483 points that display the somewhat paradoxical result of measurably stronger events for more stable flows, not only in the temperature and vertical velocity derivatives as commonplace in turbulence, but also in the amplitude of the fields themselves, contrary to what happens for homogenous isotropic turbulent flows. A flow visualization suggests that the extreme values take place in Kelvin-Helmoltz overturning events and fronts that develop in the field variables. These results are confirmed by the analysis of a simple model that we present. The model takes into consideration only the vertical velocity and temperature fluctuations and their vertical derivatives. It indicates that in stably stratified turbulence, the stronger bursts can occur when the flow is expected to be more stable. The bursts are generated by a rapid nonlinear amplification of energy stored in waves and are associated with energetic interchanges between vertical velocity and temperature (or density) fluctuations in a range of parameters corresponding to the well-known saturation regime of stratified turbulence.},

  abstract = {We derive scaling relations based on freefall and isotropy assumptions for the kinematic small-scale dynamo growth rate and amplification factor over the course of the mixing, saturation, and decay phases of the Rayleigh\textendash Taylor instability (RTI) in a fully ionized plasma. The scaling relations are tested using sets of three-dimensional, visco-resistive MHD simulations of the RTI. They are found to hold in the saturation phase, but exhibit discrepancies during the mixing and decay phases, suggesting a need to relax either the freefall or isotropy assumptions. Application of the scaling relations allows for quantitative prediction of the net amplification of magnetic energy in the kinematic dynamo phase and therefore a determination of whether the magnetic energy either remains sub-equipartition at all velocity scales or reaches equipartition with at least some scales of the turbulent kinetic energy in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios. As an example, we consider the dynamo in RTI-unstable regions of the outer envelope of a binary neutron star merger, and predict that the kinematic regime of the small-scale dynamo ends on the timescale of nanoseconds and then reaches saturation on a timescale of microseconds, which are both fast compared to the millisecond relaxation time of the post-merger.},

  abstract = {,  We extend the scaling relations of strongly (stably) stratified turbulence from the geophysical regime of unity Prandtl number to the astrophysical regime of extremely small Prandtl number applicable to stably stratified regions of stars and gas giants. A transition to a new turbulent regime is found to occur when the Prandtl number drops below the inverse of the buoyancy Reynolds number, i.e. PrRb{$<$}1PrRb{$<$}1Pr\textbackslash,Rb{$<$}1, which signals a shift of the dominant balance in the buoyancy equation. Application of critical balance arguments then derives new predictions for the anisotropic energy spectrum and dominant balance of the Boussinesq equations in the PrRb{$\ll$}1PrRb{$\ll$}1Pr\textbackslash,Rb\textbackslash ll 1 regime. We find that all the standard scaling relations from the unity PrPrPr limit of strongly stratified turbulence simply carry over if the Froude number, FrFrFr, is replaced by a modified Froude number, FrM{$\equiv$}Fr/(PrRb)1/4FrM{$\equiv$}Fr/(PrRb)1/4Fr\_M\textbackslash equiv Fr/(Pr\textbackslash,Rb)\^\{1/4\}. The geophysical and astrophysical regimes are thus smoothly connected across the PrRb=1PrRb=1Pr\textbackslash,Rb=1 transition. Applications to vertical transport in stellar radiative zones and modification to the instability criterion for the small-scale dynamo are discussed.},

  abstract = {Continuously forced, stratified shear flows occur in many geophysical systems, including flow over sills, through fjords and at the mouths of rivers and estuaries. These continuously forced shear flows can be unstable and drive turbulence, which can enhance the rate of mixing. In this study, we analyse three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an idealized stratified shear flow that is continuously forced by weakly relaxing both the buoyancy and streamwise velocity towards prescribed mean profiles. We explore a range of large and small Richardson numbers, for constant Reynolds and Prandtl numbers ( and ). After a turbulent steady state develops, three regimes are observed: (i) a weakly stratified, overturning regime, (ii) a strongly stratified, scouring regime and (iii) an intermediately stratified, intermittent regime. The overturning regime exhibits partially formed overturning billows that break down into turbulence and broaden the velocity and buoyancy interfaces. Conversely, the scouring regime exhibits internal gravity waves propagating along the strongly stratified buoyancy interface, while turbulence on either side of the buoyancy interface reinforces the stratification. The intermediate regime quasi-periodically alternates between behaviours associated with the overturning and scouring regimes. For each case, we quantify an appropriate measure of the efficiency of mixing and examine its dependence on relevant parameters including appropriate definitions of the buoyancy Reynolds number, gradient Richardson number and horizontal Froude numbers. Using a framework involving sorted buoyancy coordinates as introduced by Nakamura (J. Atmos. Sci., vol. 53, 1996, pp. 1524-1537) and Winters \& D'Asaro (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 317, 1996, pp. 179-193), we examine the underlying physical mechanisms leading to broadening and thinning of the buoyancy interface.},

  abstract = {Critical balance, a statement of the approximate equality of a timescale of motion parallel to the magnetic field with a timescale of turbulent motion perpendicular to the field, is analyzed from a statistical description of the relative motion of two particles consistent with two-point correlation in a nonlinear gyrokinetic system with collisions. Critical balance is understood from a premise that the fastest time to any spatial scale that encounters decorrelated motions sets an overall correlation time for both perpendicular and parallel scales. For a regime of weak collisionality, this leads to the approximate equality of the parallel streaming time and the perpendicular turbulent correlation time, which is a standard statement of critical balance. These two timescales are only approximately equal because of effects in parallel streaming dynamics and collisions, the former producing deviations tied to variations of perpendicular and parallel wavenumbers. Analysis of a collisional regime shows that critical balance also applies in that limit with a modified relation between parallel and perpendicular spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Magnetic field strengths inferred for relativistic outflows including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei are larger than naively expected by orders of magnitude. We present three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrating amplification and saturation of a magnetic field by a macroscopic turbulent dynamo triggered by the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz shear instability. We find rapid growth of electromagnetic energy due to the stretching and folding of field lines in the turbulent velocity field resulting from nonlinear development of the instability. Using conditions relevant for GRB internal shocks and late phases of GRB afterglow, we obtain amplification of the electromagnetic energy fraction to {$\epsilon$}B {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-3. This value decays slowly after the shear is dissipated and appears to be largely independent of the initial field strength. The conditions required for operation of the dynamo are the presence of velocity shear and some seed magnetization both of which are expected to be commonplace. We also find that the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum for the case studied obeys Kolmogorov's 5/3 law and that the electromagnetic energy spectrum is essentially flat with the bulk of the electromagnetic energy at small scales.},

By studying turbulent amplification of magnetic fields in local high-resolution simulations of neutron star merger conditions, we demonstrate that magnetar-level ({$\greaterequivlnt$} 1016 G) fields are present throughout the merger duration. We find that the small-scale turbulent dynamo converts 60\% of the randomized kinetic energy into magnetic fields on a merger timescale. Since turbulent magnetic energy dissipates through reconnection events that accelerate relativistic electrons, turbulence may facilitate the conversion of orbital kinetic energy into radiation. If 10-4 of the {$\sim$}1053 erg of orbital kinetic available gets processed through reconnection and creates radiation in the 15\textendash 150 keV band, then the fluence at 200 Mpc would be 10-7 erg cm-2, potentially rendering most merging neutron stars in the advanced LIGO and Virgo detection volumes detectable by Swift BAT.},
